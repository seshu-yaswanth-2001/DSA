Recurssion: When a function calls itself - until a specific condition is met.

if the recurssion function has no condition then main stack will be overflowed and it is called as stack Over flow

to avoid the situations like stack overflow we need to keep base condition

base condition is not limited to one it may have any number of conditions

Example:

let count = 0;
function recursion() {
  if (count === 4) return;

  console.log(count);
  count++;
  recursion();
}

recursion();
